# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the Galway Summer League 2025 Standings page by adding a dedicated top riders summary table that displays the highest performing riders across different categories. The table will provide a quick overview of leading riders without requiring users to scroll through the full embedded Google Sheets standings, improving user experience and highlighting top performers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cycling league participant, I want to see the top 10 riders in the ML (Main League) and DL (Development League) tables at a glance, so that I can quickly identify the overall leaders without scrolling through the full standings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the standings page loads THEN the system SHALL display a table showing the top 10 riders from the ML table
2. WHEN the standings page loads THEN the system SHALL display a table showing the top 10 riders from the DL table
3. WHEN displaying top riders THEN the system SHALL show rider name, current position, and total points
4. WHEN the data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate loading or error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cycling league participant, I want to see the top 5 riders in both Prime tables, so that I can quickly identify the sprint specialists and prime competition leaders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the standings page loads THEN the system SHALL display a table showing the top 5 riders from the first Prime table
2. WHEN the standings page loads THEN the system SHALL display a table showing the top 5 riders from the second Prime table

4. IF there are fewer than 5 riders in a prime table THEN the system SHALL display all available riders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the top riders table to be visually integrated with the existing page design, so that it feels like a natural part of the standings page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the top riders table is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the existing page theme
2. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL ensure the table is responsive and readable
3. WHEN the table is positioned on the page THEN the system SHALL place it prominently but not interfere with the existing Google Sheets iframe
4. WHEN displaying multiple tables THEN the system SHALL clearly label each section (ML, DL, Prime 1, Prime 2)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a league administrator, I want the top riders data to be automatically updated when the Google Sheets data changes, so that the summary table always reflects current standings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Google Sheets data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the top riders table data within a reasonable timeframe
2. WHEN fetching data from Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL handle network errors gracefully
3. IF the Google Sheets structure changes THEN the system SHALL continue to function or display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN data parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and display fallback content
